Richardson b\na University of Wisconsin \u2013 Eau Claire, Accounting and Finance Department, 105 Garfield Avenue, Eau Claire, WI 54701, United States\nb University of Arkansas, Department of Accounting, 1 University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR 72701, United States\nA R T I C L E  I N F O\nKeywords:\nData analytics\nSQL\nTableau\nData visualization\nA B S T R A C T\nAdvanced technologies have dramatically changed the ways that accounting professionals collect, analyze and \ninterpret data. Embracing the prevalent implementation of advanced technologies, accounting is moving towards \na STEM discipline and requesting accounting students be equipped with emerging technologies. In response to \nthe increasing requirements from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and CPA \nexams on students\u2019 data analytics skills, this case provides you an opportunity to complete the data analytics \nprocess by analyzing Dillard\u2019s data using Structured Query Language (SQL) and Tableau. Specifically, this case \nprovides an illustration of real-world data analysis, including the use of SQL to extract required data, the use of \nword clouds, geographic maps, and box-and-whisker plots to visualize data and outliers, an illustration of \ngrouping data by clustering, and using interactive dashboards and narrative stories to communicate results. We \naim to use software tools that you are familiar with to inspire your interest in data analytics, helping you un\u00ad\nderstand the enormous power of SQL and Tableau to query, aggregate, analyze and visualize massive data as you \nbuild your own data analytics mindset.\n1. The case\nDillard\u2019s, Inc. is a high-end department store chain based in Little \nRock, Arkansas. It offers one-stop shopping for clothes, shoes, bags, \naccessories, home and beauty products. Dillard\u2019s was founded by Wil\u00ad\nliam T Dillard in 1938. Dillard\u2019s family expanded its business empire in \nthe 1960s through acquisition and went public on the American Stock \nExchange in 1969. Currently, it operates approximately 282 stores \nacross 29 states. Texas holds the highest number of Dillard\u2019s stores, with \n57 establishments, closely followed by Florida with 42. All stores are \ncontrolled by the Dillard\u2019s family.\nThe company has been collecting daily transactional data in each of \nits stores for years. The CEO asked you, the manager of the cosmetic \ndepartment, to prepare a report to summarize company\u2019s performance. \nYou need to analyze total sales, discount rate, profit margin, sales \ngrowth rate, and return rates as required. Additionally, you are asked to \npropose an additional analysis on your own. You will access company \ndata through Microsoft SQL Server from Dillard\u2019s database. The CEO \nexpects to have an informative review of the Christmas season to help \nthe company improve its holiday sales strategy. Additionally, the CEO \nwould like to compare the performance of different states and brands to \nhelp the company make business expansion decisions and sales pro\u00ad\nmotion plans for its different brands. It is a great opportunity for you to \nimpress the CEO with a professional report using your data analytics \nskills. The data dictionary is presented in Table 1.\nAfter thinking through the analysis, you plan to complete the \nfollowing five parts: \n1) You need to extract data that is saved in different tables. Therefore, \nyou first need to find the connections between tables by generating \nthe Unified Modeling Language (UML) of the database from Micro\u00ad\nsoft SQL Server Management Studio. It is also a good habit to get \nsample data of each table first before moving into the in-depth \nanalysis (for example, using the SQL statement SELECT TOP 10 * \nFROM TABLE). This step will allow you to find missing data, \nabnormal data, and incorrect format of data recognized by Tableau.\n2) Extract data from the Microsoft server: \na) Write a SQL query to extract TRAN_AMT, ORIG_PRICE, SALE_\u00ad\nPRICE, TRAN_DATE, COST, DEPT_DESC, STATE, DEPTCENT_\u00ad\nDESC, TRAN_TYPE and TENDER_TYPE from Dillard\u2019s database.\n\u2606This article is part of a special issue entitled: \u2018STEM\u2019 published in Journal of Accounting Education.\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail addresses: shany@uwec.edu (Y.

Motivation\nData analytics has been widely integrated into accounting practices. \nWith the increasing volume and velocity of big data, accounting pro\u00ad\nfessionals are expected to develop a diverse skill set to master emerging \ntechnologies such as Tableau, Power BI, Microsoft SQL, Alteryx, UIPath, \nand Python. For example, financial accounting relies on SQL to effi\u00ad\nciently extract, aggregate, and transform data from large datasets. \nManagerial accountants use data extraction and visualization tools to \nanalyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and support data-driven \ndecision-making. Similarly, tax accountants extract and compare data \nfrom various sources to assess tax risks and develop tax planning stra\u00ad\ntegies. These technical proficiencies align accounting with STEM disci\u00ad\nplines, emphasizing its dependence on technology, quantitative \nreasoning, and problem-solving rather than solely traditional book\u00ad\nkeeping practices.\nRecognizing the increasing role of technology, the 2018 Association \nto Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) standards strength\u00ad\nened data analytics requirements, as reflected in Standard A5. Specif\u00ad\nically, faculty and students are expected to develop the ability to master \ncurrent technologies and adapt to emerging technologies (AACSB, \n2018). The CPA exam accordingly adjusted the exam sections and \ntesting content in 2022. Starting from Jan 1, 2024, candidates need to \ntake Auditing and Attestation (AUD), Financial Accounting and \nReporting (FAR), and Regulation (REG) as core exams and choose one \nout of three discipline exams, including Business Analysis and Reporting \n(BAR), Information Systems and controls (ISC), and Tax Compliance and \nPlanning (TCP). It is worth noting that all exam sections in the new exam \ncover technology-related questions. All these moves are pointing toward \naccounting being considered a STEM discipline.\nSTEM fields of study include science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. While traditionally accounting is not considered a STEM \nfield, the fact is that technology is playing a crucial role in modern ac\u00ad\ncounting. Today, accounting students not only need to learn funda\u00ad\nmental accounting concepts, such as double-entry booking and financial \nratio analysis, but also need to master STEM-related concepts, such as \ndata storage, data extraction, data analysis, data visualization, process \nautomation, and information security. For example, accounting students \nnow are expected to be proficient in using advanced technologies such as \nSQL to extract data from large relational databases and load it to Tableau \nto analyze data and visualize results. Additionally, accounting pro\u00ad\nfessionals need to develop or assist in developing new technologies for \ndifferent working scenarios, such as automating fraud detection and \nreporting, improving data security, assisting data-driven decisions, \napplying XML technologies, and providing suggestions on tax planning.\nIn response to the shift towards technologies, including Accounting \nin STEM fields would more accurately reflect the current content of \naccounting education and practices. Accounting educators and pro\u00ad\nfessionals are actively working to incorporate accounting into recog\u00ad\nnized STEM programs. This designation will enhance the technology \nskills of accounting graduates, enable them to tackle complex issues, \nimprove data security, foster innovation, and strengthen their em\u00ad\nployers\u2019 technological competitiveness.\nSpecifically, on June 11, 2021, the H.R. 3855 Accounting STEM \nPursuit Act of 20212 was introduced at the 117th Congress to the United \nStates House of Representatives Education and Labor Committee to \namend the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grant program to \nfoster career awareness in accounting as part of a well-rounded STEM \neducational experience and strengthen the earlier exposure of ac\u00ad\ncounting to elementary and secondary students. This act was broadly \n2 As of March 2025, the bills mentioned in this paragraph remain inactive, \nwith no further actions taken since their referral to the committee.\nY. Shan and V.J.

      "text": "supported by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), Center for Audit \nQuality (CAQ), Diverse Organization of Firms, National Association of \nBlack Accountants (NASBA), Inc., and American Accounting Associa\u00ad\ntion. In support of the H.R. 3855 Accounting STEM Pursuit Act of 2021, \nthe S. 3398 STEM Education in Accounting Act was introduced on Dec \n15, 2021 (reintroduced on 05/18/2023 as S.1705 STEM Education in \nAccounting Act). If passed, it would grant states and local educational \nagencies (LEAs) the authority to utilize grant funds from the Student \nSupport and Academic Enrichment Program to support accounting ed\u00ad\nucation. Particularly, LEAs can utilize these grants to establish ac\u00ad\ncounting programs, with a focus on improving access to high-quality \naccounting courses for students belonging to underrepresented groups \nup to 12th grade. Following that, the H.R. 3541 Accounting STEM \nPursuit Act of 2023 was introduced on May 18, 2023, at the 118th \nCongress with an additional finding of integrating STEM-designated \naccounting programs into middle and secondary curricula to expand \nthe accounting profession and the pipeline of accounting majors in \nhigher education. Consequently, a diverse group of young people from \nvarious backgrounds would have access to high-quality accounting \ncourses earlier, potentially attracting more students to pursue a career in \naccounting.\nOur paper aims to provide an overview of STEM certification and \nSTEM education in accounting, using a case exercise as an example to \nillustrate the application of STEM-related tools\u2014SQL and Tableau\u2014in \naccounting analysis. STEM majors require a diverse set of skills, \nincluding (1) mathematics and statistics, (2) data analysis and inter\u00ad\npretation, (3) programming and coding, (4) computer and technology \nproficiency, (5) problem-solving and critical thinking, (6) scientific \nmethod and research skills, and (7) adaptability and lifelong learning. \nOur case provides students with an opportunity to engage in the full data \nanalytics process by analyzing Dillard\u2019s data using Structured Query \nLanguage (SQL) and Tableau. Writing SQL aligns with the programming \nand coding skills essential in STEM. Using Tableau to aggregate, \nanalyze, visualize, and interpret data fulfills the STEM requirements for \ndata analysis and interpretation, mathematics and statistics, as well as \nproblem-solving and critical thinking. Our case simulates real-world \nproblem-solving students may encounter in the workplace, such as \nextracting required data from various datasets using SQL, visualizing \ndata and outliers through word clouds, geographic maps, and box-and- \nwhisker plots, grouping data via clustering, and effectively communi\u00ad\ncating analysis results using interactive dashboards and narrative stor\u00ad\nies. This case is designed to help students grasp the immense power of \nSQL and Tableau in querying, aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing \nvast datasets. By doing so, we aim to help students build their own data \nanalytics mindset that is in high demand by employers, including the \nability to: (1) ask the right questions; (2) extract, transform, and load \nrelevant data; (3) apply appropriate data analytic techniques; and (4) \ninterpret and share the results with stakeholders (Ernst & Young, 2017). \nAs many tools are interchangeable, building the data analytics mindset \ncan help students both apply the skills they learned in the working \nenvironment and easily adapt to new analytics software tools in the \nfuture.\n3.2. Background\n3.2.1. STEM and accounting\nAccording to 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(2), a STEM field of study is \ndefined as one that falls within the Department of Education\u2019s Classifi\u00ad\ncation of Instructional Programs (CIP) taxonomy. Specifically, it refers \nto fields in the two-digit series that include engineering, biological sci\u00ad\nences, mathematics, and physical sciences, or related disciplines. \nGenerally, related fields involve research, innovation, or the develop\u00ad\nment of new technologies utilizing engineering, mathematics, computer \nscience, or natural sciences (such as physical, biological, and agricul\u00ad\ntural sciences). Modern accounting is not just bookkeeping but requires \ndeep integration with math, emerging technologies, and advanced \nanalytics skills. This shift is evident as 87 percent of employers are fa\u00ad\nvoring accounting graduates who possess advanced analytics skills \n(AICPA, 2023b).\nAccountants play a crucial role in driving and managing technolog\u00ad\nical innovation in finance and business. As technology has significantly \nchanged accounting practices, companies are in high demand for ac\u00ad\ncounting professionals who can develop or assist in developing software \nand other technologies to enhance the quality and scope of audits, \npredict trends, assess the risk of fraud, and reduce cybersecurity risks. \nIncorporating artificial intelligence in accounting software also enables \ncompanies to assess real-time financial risks and provide financial, \naudit, and tax recommendations based on various circumstances. To \nkeep up with these developments, accountants need to have strong \nmathematical and technological expertise.\nOn July 29, 2022, the AICPA submitted its nomination of adding \naccounting and related Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) \ncodes to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS\u2019s) STEM Desig\u00ad\nnated Degree Program List, specifically under the \u201cT\u201d for Technology \n(AIPCA, 2022). Changing the field of study can better present the skills \nand competencies that accounting professionals are expected to acquire, \nexpand the diversity of the accounting workforce, and accelerate the \nevolution of accounting curriculums. As a result, more accounting pro\u00ad\ngrams will accelerate their incorporation of technology-related courses \nto meet current market requirements. Eventually, this will lead to more \naccounting graduates acquiring high technology skills, which are \nessential for building trust in the market.\nAdditionally, once it is approved, this classification would allow \nforeign students with F-1 Visa eligible for an extended period of 24 \nmonths for Optional Practical Training (OPT) in the U.S. beyond the \nstandard year. As of July 2023, 57 universities are offering STEM- \ndesignated Accounting Programs that they qualified for on their own \napplication (a list of these universities is provided in Appendix A). All of \nthese programs are graduate programs with an emphasis on data ana\u00ad\nlytics, development of software, cloud computing, or other emerging \ntechnology innovation skills. The visa extension gives international \nstudents of these STEM-designated Accounting Programs authorization \nto work in the U.S. for 3 years after graduation, which can help alleviate \nthe high demand for accounting professionals in the U.S.\nMany STEM core concepts are already included in today\u2019s account\u00ad\ning courses and practices, such as: writing SQL to extract relevant data \nfrom larger databases; preparing data for analysis, creating data visu\u00ad\nalizations to analyze data or communicate results; using statistics soft\u00ad\nware to assist decision-making; recording and protecting data using \ncryptography and cybersecurity; organizing data into relationship da\u00ad\ntabases; transmitting financial data using XML Technology and con\u00ad\nducting predictive and prescriptive analytics to address management \nquestions (AICPA, 2023a).\nOur case includes several of the aforementioned STEM core concepts. \nBy completing the case, students will review how data is stored in a \nrelational database and how to extract requested data using SQL from a \nlarge relational database. After extracting the data, students will need to \ntransform and clean data to prepare it for further analysis. They will \nthen use Tableau to analyze and visualize the data to generate valuable \nbusiness insights.\nEmbracing the demands of incorporating analytics skills into ac\u00ad\ncounting education, there has been a growing number of teaching cases \npublished in the last 15 years that use SQL and Tableau to query and \nvisualize data. Prior studies provide examples of using SQL to create and \nquery the data (Lambert, Holladay & Drum, 2016; Lawson & Street, \n2021; Lee & Casterella, 2023) and using Tableau to create traditional \ngraphs, geographic maps, and dashboards (Cunningham & Stein, 2018; \nHoelscher & Mortimer, 2018; Janvrin, Raschke, & Dilla, 2014; Kokina, \nPachamanova, & Corbett, 2017; Weirich, Tschakert, & Kozlowski, \n2018). We summarize teaching cases with an emphasis on data analytics \nin Table 2. While prior literature mostly focuses on helping students \npractice a few steps included in the data analytics process, our case \nY. Shan and V.J.

      "text": "provides students an opportunity to explore the complete data analytics \nprocess, including identifying questions, extracting data, cleansing data, \nanalyzing data, visualizing analysis results, and reporting and present\u00ad\ning results. In addition to data analytics skills, students are able to \npractice and improve their critical thinking and oral communication \nskills. The study of Garas and Wright (2024) also presents a compre\u00ad\nhensive case that covers the entire analytics process. However, while \ntheir focus is on no-code and low-code technologies, our case requires \nstudents to write queries themselves for data extraction and trans\u00ad\nformation. Furthermore, our case tasks students with creating multiple \ntypes of visualizations in Tableau.\n3.3. Educational objectives\nChanging the curriculum to intertwine data analytics and accounting \nbrings opportunities and challenges to accounting majors. To embrace \nthe emerging technology, the accounting curriculum needs to corre\u00ad\nspondingly adapt to the data analytics requirements. Students are \nrequired to be equipped with data analytics skills, including data \nextraction, transformation, analytics, visualization, etc. We developed \nthis case in response to the evolution of the accounting curriculum to \nprepare our students for advanced data analysis requirements. Students \nare able to practice the data analytics skills they learned including data \ncleaning, data verification, data normalization, data extraction, data \nanalysis, data visualization, data reporting, and business oral commu\u00ad\nnication. By accessing the real company\u2019s data (using the Dillard\u2019s \ndatabase), students better understand the database, learn to fix the \nproblems they are facing as they extract and analyze the data, simulate \nthe data analysis and reporting procedures, and build the data analytics \nmindset. As they are analyzing accounting data of product brands they \nare familiar with, it reinforces students\u2019 understanding of the capability \nand importance of data analytics. Additionally, our case shows how to \ncreate a word cloud and uses box-and-whisker plots to rank information \nand find outliers as well as uses clustering in Tableau to explore infor\u00ad\nmation and patterns hiding behind the data.\nFollowing the case instruction, students are required to extract data, \nload data, analyze data, visualize data, and more importantly use data to \naddress accounting questions. Students are also encouraged to go \nbeyond the questions often asked by the CEO (included in the Deliver\u00ad\nables section) and find additional information that may affect managers\u2019 \ndecisions. Specifically, students get the chance to find UML from the \nMicrosoft SQL server, browse and clean data, write SQL queries to exact \ndata in Tableau or Excel, and visualize data in Tableau. The skills stu\u00ad\ndents learn from this case can be applied to different workplace settings. \nIt can also help students adapt to other data extraction software or \nvisualization tools, such as MySQL and Microsoft Power BI. The \ncomprehensive case can empower students to build the data analytics \nmindset to analyze a substantial volume of data that is hard to analyze in \nExcel and use data to answer questions. Additionally, the exploratory \nanalysis allows students to practice letting the data tell the story and \ndisplay the underlying patterns.\nSpecifically, the learning objectives for this case include the \nfollowing: \n\u2022 Create database UML.\n\u2022 Extract, transform, and clean data from Microsoft SQL server using \nMicrosoft SQL Query in Tableau or Excel.\n\u2022 Create the geographic map, word cloud, and box-whisker-plots to \nestimate the sales performance, discount level, and profit margin \nlevel of cosmetic products of Dillard\u2019s in Tableau.\n\u2022 Conduct cluster analysis in Tableau to explore the nature groups of \ncosmetic product brands to make better promotion plans in the \nfuture.\n\u2022 Use filters and page functions to drill down into data for different \nmonths or states in Tableau.\n\u2022 Conduct KPI analysis in Tableau by adding a reference line and \nadjusting the color center.\n\u2022 Develop the data analytics mindset and critical thinking skills to \ncomplete the whole data analytics procedure.\n\u2022 Produce an analysis report that includes visualization graphs, dis\u00ad\ncussions, and suggestions.\n3.4. Case prerequisites\nIf the instructor uses this case as a capstone project requiring stu\u00ad\ndents to complete it independently, students should have a basic \nknowledge of SQL for data extraction and transformation, as well as \nadvanced visualization skills in Tableau, including creating geographic \nmaps, word clouds, and conducting cluster and KPI analysis. If the \ninstructor teaches the case step by step in class, it is recommended that \nstudents acquire basic SQL and Tableau skills before the case is \nintroduced.\n3.5. Evidence of efficacy\nThe case has been implemented in Spring 2021, Fall 2021, Fall 2022, \nand Spring 2023 in an undergraduate-level accounting data analytics \ncourse in the accounting program at a mid-size public university in the \nmidwestern United States. It is a 400-level elective course developed in \nSpring 2021. All the students were seniors. All classes were delivered in \nperson. The course had enrollments of 10 students in Spring 2021, 16 \nstudents in Fall 2021, 6 students in Fall 2022, and 13 students in Spring \n2023.

      "text": "Tableau throughout the semester. Before introducing the case, students \nlearn basic skills about using SQL clauses to query data (such as SELECT, \nJOIN, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY) and use Tableau to visualize and \nanalyze data in Tableau (including editing data, combining tables, \ncreating different kinds of visualization graphs, conduct clustering \nanalysis, and create dashboards and stories). Then, all 45 students \nenrolled in this course complete this case as a capstone assignment. The \ncase is introduced in week 11 and submitted in week 13 before the final \nexam. The presentations are scheduled for week 13. Students are \nrequired to complete the case individually. Example screenshots are \nprovided to help students check their progress.\nWe evaluated the efficacy of the case by comparing the accuracy of \nmultiple-choice questions before and after the completion of the case. \nStudents were asked to answer 7 multiple choice questions (3 points \neach) about data extraction, data cleaning, data analysis, and data \nvisualization before the introduction of the case. After the completion of \nthe case, students were asked to answer the same questions again. \nTable 3 presents the questions and results of the pre-test and post-test \nanalysis. Results show that students\u2019 performance significantly \nimproved on all SQL query questions and most Tableau-related ques\u00ad\ntions (p-value < 0.05 for the first 6 questions). It is worth noting that \nstudents\u2019 average grades on a complicated SQL query question (question \n4) and a clustering question (question 6) notably increased, showing \ntheir better understanding of SELECT and WHERE SQL clauses, and the \nfunction of clustering. Students\u2019 perception of the Story function in \nTableau was roughly the same as students already understood this \nconcept well before they completed the case.\n3.6. Implementation guidance\nThis case aims to evaluate data analytics skills students learned at the \nend of an accounting data analytics course and help students build a data \nanalytics mindset. It can be used in an advanced accounting data ana\u00ad\nlytics course for senior undergraduate students or graduate students. \nStudents need to apply the comprehensive skills they learned to write \nSQL queries, conduct explanatory and exploratory analyses, and \ncommunicate results. This case allows students to estimate financial \naccounting measures using the data from a familiar department store \ncompany. This case can be used as a capstone project that requests \nstudents to submit the assignment at the end of the semester. Instructors \ncan customize the required time period and accounting measures as \nneeded. The oral presentation is also optional depending on the schedule \nof the class.\nAlternatively, this case can be used as an in-class practice and require \nstudents to use their analysis to complete in-class quizzes. For example, \nthe instructor can introduce the fundamental skills of writing SQL \nqueries and conducting analysis in Tableau over the semester. Students \nbenefit from step-by-step guidance as they learn to use this software but \nwould need the help of a comprehensive case to help them master these \nanalytics skills and practice critical thinking skills. By completing this \ncase, students would be able to use analytics skills to answer business \nquestions, rather than complete a specific instructor\u2019s request.

      "text": "being said, this case can help students review and practice the data \nanalytics skills they learned in a business setting and apply these skills to \nassist managers in making data-driven decisions. Additionally, students \nwere tasked with creating a formal report for the CEO and were required \nto address the CEO\u2019s (instructor\u2019s) questions during the presentation. \nThe case evaluates students\u2019 familiarity with analytics techniques and \nfinancial accounting analysis. Detailed requirements and example \nanalysis screenshots will be provided to help students assess their \nprogress. The solutions include step-by-step instructions, and screen\u00ad\nshots of analysis outputs for key steps are demonstrated in section 3.4. \nInstructors can use the solutions to validate the accuracy of students\u2019 \nsubmissions or use the solutions as teaching manuals if students have \nlimited analytics experience. The solutions highlight the steps where \nstudents frequently make mistakes.\nWe have used the case in a 400-level undergraduate accounting data \nanalytics course. This course uses the textbook \u201cData Analytics for Ac\u00ad\ncounting\u201d (Richardson, Terrell, & Teeter, 2023) which gives textbook \nusers permission to access Dillard\u2019s database through Microsoft SQL \nServer via the remote desktop of the University of Arkansas. If the \ninstructor does not use the textbook but would like to access Dillard\u2019s \ndata that was used in this case, please contact the authors.\nWe recommend that the instructors complete the case by following \nthe step-by-step instructions as part of their preparation. For textbook \nusers, it may take about 1 to 2 h to complete the case. For first-time users \nof the server, it may take approximately 2 to 4 h. Please allow additional \ntime if the instructor plans to request data from the corresponding \nauthor and set up a separate server connection.\nTo complete the whole case, students need approximately 8 h. It \nconsists of 2 h of data extraction, 3 h of data analysis and data visuali\u00ad\nzation, 2 h of report preparation, and 1 h of presentation preparation. \nFor students of the data analytics course and information systems \ncourse, we recommend allowing students to complete the case in 2 \nweeks. Instructors may also consider providing a Q&A session during \nlectures to assist students in making progress and providing them with \nthe opportunity to successfully complete the entire project.\n3.7. Recommended solutions\n3.7.1. Access Dillard\u2019s data\nInstructors can get access to Dillard\u2019s data from the following \nmethods: \na) If the instructor uses the textbook Data Analytics for Accounting \n(Richardson, Terrell, & Teeter, 2023), the instructor can request \nremote desktop accounts of the University of Arkansas for students \nby following the instructions included in instructor resources. The \ninstructor will also get the server and database information from \ninstructor resources. If so, students can follow the instructions and \nlog in to their accounts to get access to Tableau and the SQL server \nwe used for our case.\nb) If the instructor does not use the textbook, the instructor can request \nremote desktop accounts or a copy of the Excel file by contacting the \ncorresponding author. The corresponding author will also send the \ninstructor the server and database information. Students then can \ndownload the Tableau desktop and get a free student license for one \nyear from: https://www.tableau.com/academic/students.\n3.7.2. Step-by-step instructions\nStep-by-step instructions are provided in Appendix B. Students often \nstruggle with writing queries, particularly with identifying and \nexcluding abnormal values. Additionally, they may forget to filter the \ndata to the cosmetics department in SQL query. While most students can \nsuccessfully generate the required visualizations, some may need assis\u00ad\ntance with the word cloud and box-and-whisker plot. An effective way to \nsupport students is to schedule a Q&A session where they can ask \nquestions directly. In cases where data loads slowly or fails to load, \ninstructors can provide the following instructions: \no Stop waiting for Tableau to respond after 10 min of waiting if correct \nserver and database information were entered. (Note: It is important \nto give this instruction to students. If the data or visualizations can\u2019t \nbe loaded within 10 min, it is most likely that it won\u2019t be loaded. \nStudents may waste hours waiting without this instruction.)\no If Tableau fails to respond within 10 min despite a high-speed, stable \ninternet connection, try logging into the remote desktop accounting \nlater. (Note: Sometimes server issues cause delays. Logging in at a \ndifferent time may resolve the problem.)\no If the issue persists after several attempts, contact the instructor. \n(Note: Occasionally, students may be unable to load data into Tab\u00ad\nleau or create visualizations due to the high volume of data used in \nthe analysis. In this case, instructors can provide a smaller dataset in \nExcel to help students complete the remaining steps and ask students \nto submit their SQL queries separately. Based on our experience, \nmost students can complete the cases without this step.)\n3.7.3. Example of analysis report\nAn example of the analysis report is provided in Appendix C. In\u00ad\nstructors can contact the corresponding author to obtain a copy of the \nTableau solutions.\n4. Conclusion\nWe believe this case presents an engaging and practical real-world \nscenario that enables students to access the data server of a familiar \nreal-world department store company in the U.S. and analyze product \nbrands they are familiar with. Our comprehensive case shows students \nthe whole picture of data analytics, starting from asking business \nquestions, collecting data, analyzing data, visualizing data, and \ncommunicating results, which can help students practice data analytics \nskills as well as build a data analytics mindset. The case is designed to \nhelp students understand how companies use SQL and Tableau to \ngenerate valuable information and make data-driven decisions. In\u00ad\nstructors can use this case directly in an accounting data analytics or \naccounting information systems class or use the adapted version of a \ncommonly taught financial accounting or managerial accounting class. \nIn case students have no prior experience learning Microsoft SQL or \nTableau, the instructor can first show students how to complete the case \n(or a specific part of the case) step by step, following the recommended \nsolutions, then ask students to replicate the analysis using a different \ndata period or a different department for practice or a graded assign\u00ad\nment. This case can also be extended by asking students to propose \nadditional questions based on their original analyses and conduct \nadditional analyses to find the answers.\nWe here offer a few additional analyses that can be added to the case: \n(1) compare the return rate of online transactions and in-store trans\u00ad\nactions; (2) compare the sales growth rate of online transactions and in- \nstore transactions; (3) compare the return rate of gift card transactions \nand bank card transactions; (4) compare the sales growth rates between \ndifferent departments; (5) analyze the relationship between sales and \ncustomer distance; (6) analyze if higher discount rates are associated \nwith higher sales; (7) compare the profit margin between different de\u00ad\npartments; (8) analyze customers\u2019 preference on product colors in \ndifferent regions; (9) analyze customers\u2019 preference on product colors in \nseasons, and (10) analyze the customer retention rates over different \nstates.\nAdditionally, this case can be adapted to other accounting courses. \nFor example: \n(1) Application of this case to the financial accounting course:\nThis case is primarily designed for financial accounting settings. \nConsidering the complexity of the case, the financial accounting \nY.

Trend analysis of sales growth rate.\n(ii) Sales fluctuated significantly between January and August 2015, then increased rapidly after August until the end of the year. Although the \nsales growth rates decreased between January and August 2016, the decline was smoother compared to 2015.\n(iii) Since we only have partial data for October 2016 and missing data for November and December 2016, we can only compare the sales growth \nrate between January and October for 2015 and 2016. We observed that sales generally decreased from January to August in both 2015 and 2016. \nThe sales growth rates dropped sharply in March and August 2015, but not in 2016.\n(iv) The sales growth rates dropped sharply in March and August 2015, but not in 2016. These two declines in 2015 followed sales increases in \nFebruary and June. The drops may have been caused by the cessation of promotional activities offered in February and June 2015. This issue \nappears to have been addressed in 2016.\n(v) Based on the sales growth rates for 2015 and 2016, we can predict that the sales growth rate for February 2017 may be close to 20 %.\n(vi) The line chart is especially good at discovering trends.\n(vii) We can apply trend analysis to examine the trends in sales volume, profit growth, and other financial data.\n(viii) We can use the word cloud to compare the sales growth rates of different brands. Additionally, we can use the geographic map to compare the \nsales growth rate of different states.\nf) (i) Return rate analysis.\nY. Shan and V.J.

      "text": "f) Dashboard.\nFig. C12. Dashboard.\nFig. C.12 presents the dashboard analysis for Texas, utilizing the geographic map as a filter. The most popular cosmetic brands in Texas are \nClinique, Estee Lauder, Lancome, Mac, and Chanel for Women. Notably, Chanel for Women boasts a higher profit margin compared to other popular \nbrands, and Estee Lauder is particularly favored in Texas. Texas stores often offer substantial discounts on Fridays, with rates about three times higher \nthan the average discount rate. Previous analysis indicates that sales are likely to stay at a similar level on Fridays, despite the stores offering greater \ndiscounts on that day. This implies that providing larger discounts may not significantly boost sales but could potentially impact customers\u2019 perception \nof product pricing.\nAs a result, our company may want to consider implementing other promotional strategies instead of relying solely on low discount offers. By \nexploring alternative approaches, we can maintain customers\u2019 confidence in product pricing while finding effective ways to drive sales and enhance \noverall customer satisfaction. \nY.
